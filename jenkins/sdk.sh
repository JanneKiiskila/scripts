# We do not use a nightly SDK as seed for bootstrapping because the next major Alpha SDK release would also have to use the last published Alpha release SDK as seed.
# Also, we don't want compiler bugs to propagate from one nightly SDK to the next even though the commit in question was reverted.
# Having a clear bootstrap path is our last safety line before insanity for that kind of bugs, and is a requirement for reproducibility and security.
# Fore more info, read Ken Thompson's Turing Award Lecture "Reflections on Trusting Trust".
# In rare cases this will mean that a huge compiler update has to be split because first a released SDK with a newer compiler is needed to compile an even newer compiler
# (or linker, libc etc). For experiments one can download the nightly/developer SDK and start the bootstrap from it locally but exposing this functionality in Jenkins would
# cause more confusion than helping to understand what the requirements are to get SDK changes to a releasable state.
